## About This Project

The point of this project was to learn React and Tailwind following different instructions.  

We had to follow a mock-up for the front-end part and work with a DB created by the back-end part. 

Instructions =>  

The COGIP is a company which we don't know a lot about apart that they produce Jean-Michel toys and that they are serious workers check. They also have incredible employees within their rank. 

Jean-Christian Ranu works in accounting at the COGIP. He has been using an old, ugly and incomplete software for years, making him go between it and excels sheet. Jean-Christian like paella, crosswords and his coworker Muriel Perrache. 

Your mission here is to code a web application which will respond to the needs and desire of Jean-Christian.
